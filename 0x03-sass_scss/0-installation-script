Installing SASS

1. Verified that Node.js was already installed.

2. Opened the project folder in the terminal.

3. Installed Sass locally as a development dependency:
   npm install sass --save-dev

4. Confirmed the installation by checking the version:
   npx sass --version

5. Added a script to the package.json file to compile Sass:
   "scripts": {
   "sass": "sass src/styles.scss dist/styles.css"
   }
